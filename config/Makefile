#NOTES- The "DIRS" order is based on compile time dependencies.
#     - The user must modify SUPPORT and EPICS_BASE for local configuration.
#     - To support multiple configurations, use multiple config* directories
#     - Support modules can be shared between configurations only if
#	dependencies are not violated.  Only the "DIRS" are the target of
#	gnumake.  If this configuration is using a support module built by
#	another configuration, then the	DIRS line for that support module
#       must be commented out (i.e, must begin with a '#').
